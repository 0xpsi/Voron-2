1. What you need to run Klipper on the Voron 2
	- 2x Ardunio Mega (I'm using 2650s)
	- 2x RAMPs shields (I'm using $4 china boards converted to 24v)
	- 1x Raspberry Pi (I'm using RPi 3b but a 2 will work)
		- Pi Zero W might work but not tested
		- Bananna Pi/ Orange Pi should work great but untested ATM
	- If using 24v PSU 1/2x buck converter(s)
		- one for 5v to power the Megas and RPi
		- one for 12v to power any 12v fans
	- 7x Stepper drivers (I used A4988s and they worked excellent)


2. Here is a small list of features that you can expect to have with Klipper
	- Working Gantry leveling using inductive probe
	- Excellent motion planner that even RRF is not using
	- Pressure advance that works amazingly
	- OctoPrint control
	- Wireless connectivity
	- Inductive Probe and Mechanical Z switch working
	- Start and End slicer scripts now in the config
		- Just use print_start and print_end in your slicer and change the config to behave how you want it to
	- (New features added if requested and able to be done)
