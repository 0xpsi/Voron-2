# Logitech C270 Webcam Mount

### Overview

Designed to mount the [Logitech C270](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Widescreen-designed-Calling-Recording/dp/B004FHO5Y6) webcam to the front left side of the gantry. There is a small USB wire recess to wrap the cable around and run down the length of the gantry to the rest of the default cable management solutions. A USB extension will be required to run the cable properly. The camera is angled so it should clear side panels if enclosed as well.

### Requirements

 * 1x C270 Webcam
 * 1x M3x8 SHCS
 * 1x M3x16 SHCS
 * 1x M3 T-nut
