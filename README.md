Firmware, plans, and parts for VORON RepRap printer

## Updates: ##

_Apr 22, 2016:_ 
Massive update to the manual. All motion system are done. Next is filamnt systems, and wiring. 
Also, added a BSP adapter for E3D Titan.

In other news, we have a sub-reddit now! Link at the top of the page.

_Apr 19, 2016:_  
Updated the BOM to reflect the REV B components. Link updated.

_Apr 17, 2016:_  
REV B Carriage is up. Belt tensioning every each way. I've cleaned up the folder to get rid of some older stuff nobody should be using now anyway.

_Apr 15, 2016:_  
Quick update: The manual stalled out due to work on REV B of the X Carriage. At I started writing down the process, I became convinced belt tensioning is a thing that needs to happen. So I'm bringing back a version of what I had on the prototype printer. New carriage will also have a better way to mount a single E3D hot end, so you don't have to take apart X Carriage to remove it.

There are a few other special projects in the works, one of them involving E3D Titan ;)  

REV B will be going up tomorrow after I have a chance to put some more QA time on it.  

_Apr  4, 2016:_  
Updated BOM to reflect some changes discussed on GitHub. Big thanks to codexmas for QA work. Checked in a PDF version of the BOM. Manual is getting closer to being finished.

_Mar 22, 2016:_  
REV A STLs are published. Updated to the X Carriage to house a blower fan. Also updated the BOM to reflect the new configuration.

_Mar 8, 2016:_  
ver1.0 of the STLs has been released. Happy printing.
